/**
 * Tool-use loop driver — coordinates multi-turn agentic interactions
 * with the Anthropic API in Anthropic API mode.
 *
 * The pattern:
 *   1. Send messages (with tool definitions) → SDK streams text deltas
 *   2. If finalMessage.stop_reason === "tool_use", extract tool_use blocks
 *   3. Execute each tool locally → build tool_result blocks
 *   4. Append assistant turn + user turn (with tool_results) to history
 *   5. Loop until stop_reason !== "tool_use"
 *
 * Per-iteration callbacks let the chat-view stream text deltas, surface
 * tool invocations in the status bar, and aggregate cost across turns.
 *
 * Safety rails:
 *   - MAX_ITERATIONS prevents an infinite tool loop (model gone wild)
 *   - Tool errors return as is_error=true content; the model can recover
 *   - The activeStream reference is passed through so abort() works at
 *     any iteration boundary

// System prompt sent with every SDK-mode request. Covers four observed
// model failure modes: (1) paraphrasing the deny reason instead of
// quoting it verbatim, (2) improvising "this path is probably a typo"
// speculation, (3) suggesting File Explorer / Command Prompt
// workarounds that the user's protected-pattern choice was meant to
// prevent, (4) occasionally stopping silently after a tool refusal
// (surfaces as "(No response)" in the chat). Fourth one matters
// because Claude's `stop_reason` after a tool_result with is_error=true
// is sometimes just an immediate end_turn with no text content, and
// the user sees nothing.
//
// No mention of "Claude Code", "hooks", or "~/.claude" here — this is
// the SDK path, so the CLI-specific vocabulary from
// HERMES_SYSTEM_PROMPT_HINT (claude-code.js) doesn't apply.

  "You are running inside the Hermes Obsidian plugin. The user's " +
  "own protected-pattern list inside Hermes decides which file " +
  "paths and shell commands require approval or are refused. " +
  "· When a tool returns a refusal with a `reason` field, output " +
  "ONLY that reason to the user — no preamble before it (no " +
  "\"The Hermes plugin is blocking this\", no \"The Hermes hook\", " +
  "no \"You'll need to first\"), and no epilogue after it (no " +
  "\"I can't bypass this\", no \"it's enforced by the Hermes " +
  "plugin\", no \"once you've done that, I can proceed\"). The " +
  "reason is self-contained; anything you add degrades it. " +
  "· Do not paraphrase, add context about the enforcement " +
  "mechanism, expand with your own theories, or suggest alternative " +
  "workarounds (File Explorer, Command Prompt, PowerShell, manual " +
  "deletion, admin elevation). The reason tells the user exactly " +
  "how to adjust settings if they want to allow the operation. " +
  "· Do not speculate that the path might be a typo, might not " +
  "exist, or might not be a standard system path. The refusal is " +
  "about a pattern match, not path validity. " +
  "· Always produce a text response after a tool refusal or error " +
  "— never end your turn silently. At minimum, echo the reason. " +
  "· Never use the words \"hook\", \"hooks\", \"pre-tool\", " +
  "\"PreToolUse\", \"PostToolUse\", \"intercept\", \"IPC\", " +
  "\"enforced by\", \"before the command runs\", \"bypass\", or " +
  "any description of how Hermes checks for protected patterns. " +
  "Say plainly that the operation matched one of the user's " +
  "protected patterns, and point them at Settings → Hermes to " +
  "adjust the list.";

 * @param {object} args

 *   `history` is mutated IN PLACE (push) by this loop. The caller
 *   (anthropic-api.js `send`) captures `historyCheckpoint = history.length`
 *   BEFORE calling runToolLoop so it can roll back on error via
 *   `history.length = historyCheckpoint`. That rollback depends on this
 *   array being the SAME reference the caller holds — if a future
 *   refactor passes a copy here or clones internally, the caller's
 *   history will keep partial turn content after a thrown error.
 *   If you need to decouple: take a `pushTurn(turn)` callback argument
 *   from the caller and let the caller own all history mutations.
