/**
 * SessionStart hook (v0.6.0 Stage 7 + Round-10 F9 fix + Round-11
 * shared-helper refactor).
 *
 * Verifies the Hermes IPC server is reachable before letting the CC
 * session start. If it isn't, returns `{continue: false, stopReason}`
 * so CC refuses to begin. This is the bootstrap fail-closed gate
 * that keeps a user from accidentally running a CC session against a
 * crashed/disabled plugin and getting silent unprotection.
 *
 * Reachability test: send a `ping` request. The plugin replies
 * `{ok: true}` if its IPC server + handler registry are live. Any
 * timeout, connection error, or non-ok response → fail-closed.
 *
 * Special case: when HERMES_PERMISSION_SOCKET isn't set in the
 * environment, the user has hooks enabled but Hermes didn't wire the
 * socket. Treat that as fail-closed too — same rationale.
 *
 * Defense in depth (Round-10 F9 + Round-11 refactor):
 *   1. Per-step try/catch inside main()
 *   2. PING_TIMEOUT_MS bounds the IPC round-trip
 *   3. installHookDeadline() bounds the WHOLE hook including
 *      readStdinJson — without it, a hung stdin would let CC's 10s
 *      hook timeout fire with undocumented behavior.
 *
 * Note on `source`: CC tells us `source: "startup"` for fresh sessions
 * and `source: "resume"` for resumed sessions. We block both.
