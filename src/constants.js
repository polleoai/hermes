  //                      - true           : refuse outright, no modal
  //   false          : Protected Mode is down. Protected patterns are NOT
  //                    enforced. Paths / commands matching the list
  //                    are treated exactly like any other op — the
  //                    permission mode (Prompt / Safe / YOLO) governs

  // mechanism differs (SDK uses in-process permission-gate; CLI uses
  // hooks or a permissions.deny settings file), but the user-visible
  // outcome is the same for any given setting combination.
